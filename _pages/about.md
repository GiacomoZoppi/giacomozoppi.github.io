After a bachelor's degree in Mathematics for Finance and Insurance at the University of Torino, in 2017, I obtained a master's degree in Stochastics and Data Science at the same university two years later. During my master's degree, I spent a semester at NOVA IMS University of Lisbon, in the Master's Degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics, thanks to the Erasmus+ program. Meanwhile, I was part of the Allievi Honors Program at the Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin for four years, earning a Master in Economics. As of October 2020, I enrolled in the Ph.D. in Modeling and Data Science at the University of Torino. In September 2022 I joined the EPIcx Lab as a visiting Ph.D. student.</div>

My main research areas concern Genetic Programming, the field in which I developed my master's thesis, and the modeling of epidemiological phenomena in the animal world. Currently, I am studying the impact of grazing on the spread of cattle diseases.</div>
